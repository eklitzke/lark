Lark, a music server
====================

Lark implements a network music daemon in C++ by glueing off the shelf
libraries.  In particular it uses the following libraries:

 * Thrift
 * Gstreamer
 * TagLib
 * SQLite

Lark is headless and is controlled via TCP through an API generated by Thrift.
See interfaces/lark.thrift for details about the API.   Automatically generated
Python bindings are in py/.  Additional bindings for the other languages (such
as Java, Erlang, Ruby, Perl, Haskell) can easily be created by adding additonal
Makefiles for each (see py/Makefile.am for an example).
